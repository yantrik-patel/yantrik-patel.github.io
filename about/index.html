<p>Hello there, I am Yantrik from India. I am a Data Analyst.
I hold Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Engineering and I have completed Google Professional Data Analysis course. Also getting my hands dirty with a Machine Learning Course from Stanford University.
Data and Statistic have been a part of my life from long time. It has helped me during my past experience
when I worked as SCM and Procurement Analyst in Manufacturing and Automotive Industry.
Apart from Data Analysis, I love to travel and try out different cuisines. Yes, I am a Big Foodie!</p>
